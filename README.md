### 1. Don't touch anything that isn't in your folder. 
### 2. When making a webpage in your folder, make sure to begin it with this:
````
---
layout: a
title: Your Title
---
````
### where you replace "Your Title" with the title you want.

## What can you use?
You can use many things, but the most important is Font Awesome (search it up for more information.) For other things, just ask me.
